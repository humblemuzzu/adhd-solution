# Project: FocusFlow Lite

## 1. Overview
**FocusFlow Lite** is an ADHD-friendly productivity application designed to help users overcome task initiation hurdles, maintain focus, and gain quick dopamine rewards for completing tasks. We aim to keep the interface simple, with minimal friction to start working on tasks and micro-steps.

### Key Objectives
1. **Immediate Action**: Provide a single-tap "Focus Sprint" feature that starts a short timed session (e.g., 10–15 minutes).
2. **Micro-Steps**: Prompt users to break tasks into smaller subtasks for quick wins.
3. **Gamified Rewards**: Show subtle achievements and progress bars to deliver positive reinforcement.
4. **Optional Body Doubling**: A lightweight co-working feature that helps ADHD users stay accountable by connecting them with a “focus buddy.”

## 2. MVP Feature Set
1. **Dashboard/Home Screen**  
   - Displays top 3–5 tasks for the day.  
   - Shows a daily progress bar or ring.
2. **Focus Sprint Button**  
   - One-click to start a 10–15 min countdown.  
   - Nudges user if idle or if the session ends.
3. **Micro-Step Wizard**  
   - When creating a task, user is prompted to add 2–3 micro-steps.  
   - Each step is quickly checkable with a visual indicator.
4. **Brain Dump (Inbox)**  
   - Quick add for random thoughts or tasks that come up mid-session.  
   - Items auto-sort into an “Inbox” for review.
5. **Light Gamification**  
   - Confetti animation or “+10 points” whenever a micro-step is completed.  
   - A daily progress bar that resets each day.


## 4. Unique Selling Points
1. **ADHD-Centric**: Minimal clutter, short bursts of work, and micro-step approach.  
2. **Immediate Start**: One-tap Focus Sprint, removing friction from the user’s workflow.  
3. **Reward Mechanics**: Frequent positive reinforcement for each micro-step.  
4. **Optional Body Doubling**: Quick, lightweight co-working without bloated meeting features.

## 5. Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**  
   - Core dashboard, micro-steps, focus timer, basic progress bar.  
2. **Phase 2**  
   - Light gamification expansions, body doubling feature, and “brain dump” enhancements.  
3. **Phase 3**  
   - AI-based nudges, advanced analytics, routine building, deeper gamification.

## 6. Development Timeline
- **Week 1**: Set up repo, build basic dashboard layout, integrate task CRUD with a back end.  
- **Week 2**: Implement Focus Sprint button + micro-step wizard + minimal gamification.  
- **Week 3**: Polish UI/UX, finalize daily progress bar, release test build to internal testers.

## 7. Status & Next Steps
- **Current Status**: Finalizing MVP feature requirements, UI wireframes, and architecture decisions.  
- **Next Steps**: Begin front-end implementation and connect to a minimal Node/Firebase back end.
